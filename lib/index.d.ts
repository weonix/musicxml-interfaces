 * of the default forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0).

 * to a coda sign. If there are multiple jumps, the value
 * of these parameters can be used to name and distinguish
 * them. If segno or coda is used, the divisions attribute
 * can also be used to indicate the number of divisions
 * per quarter note. Otherwise sound and MIDI generating
 * programs may have to recompute this.
 *
 * By default, a dalsegno or dacapo attribute indicates that
 * the jump should occur the first time through, while a
 * tocoda attribute indicates the jump should occur the second
 * time through. The time that jumps occur can be changed by
 * using the time-only attribute.
 *
 * Forward-repeat is used when a forward repeat sign is
 * implied, and usually follows a bar line. When used it

 * rest, which can be ambiguous in written notation and
 * different among parts and voices. The value may also be
 * "yes" to indicate no change to the final duration.
 *
 * If the sound element applies only particular times through a
 * repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which times to apply
 * the sound element. The value is a comma-separated list of
 * positive integers arranged in ascending order, indicating
 * which times through the repeated section that the element
 * applies.
 *

 * Yes indicates pizzicato, no indicates arco.

 *
 * The damper-pedal, soft-pedal, and sostenuto-pedal
 * attributes effect playback of the three common piano
 * pedals and their MIDI controller equivalents. The yes
 * value indicates the pedal is depressed; no indicates
 * the pedal is released. A numeric value from 0 to 100
 * may also be used for half pedaling. This value is the

 * The score-instrument element allows for multiple

 * element, each score-instrument has a required ID
 * attribute, a name, and an optional abbreviation. The
 * instrument-name and instrument-abbreviation are
 * typically used within a software application, rather
 * than appearing on the printed page of a score.
 *
 * A score-instrument element is also required if the
 * score specifies MIDI 1.0 channels, banks, or programs.
 * An initial midi-instrument assignment can also
 * be made here.
 *
 * The instrument-sound and virtual-instrument elements
 * are new as of Version 3.0. The instrument-sound element
 * describes the default timbre of the score-instrument. This
 * description is independent of a particular virtual or
 * MIDI instrument specification and allows playback to be
 * shared more easily between applications and libraries.
 * The virtual-instrument element defines a specific virtual
 * instrument used for an instrument sound. The
 * virtual-library element indicates the virtual instrument
 * library name, and the virtual-name element indicates the
 * library-specific name for the virtual instrument.
 *
 * The solo and ensemble elements are new as of Version
 * 2.0. The solo element is present if performance is
 * intended by a solo instrument. The ensemble element
 * is present if performance is intended by an ensemble
 * such as an orchestral section. The text of the
 * ensemble element contains the size of the section,
 * or is empty if the ensemble size is not specified.
 *
 * The midi-instrument element is defined in the common.mod
 * file, as it can be used within both the score-part and
 * sound elements.
